PyMurTree is a Python wrapper for the [MurTree project](https://github.com/DCC/murtree). The MurTree algorithm constructs optimal classification trees that minimize the misclassification score of a given dataset while respecting constraints on depth and number of feature nodes. The sparse objective, which penalizes each node added in the tree, is also supported.

## Installation

Before attempting to install pymurtree, make sure your system has the following software available: Python version 3.7 or higher and pip.

### Install from source using `pip`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MurTree/pymurtree.git
cd pymurtree

# Optional: build pymurtree within a virtual environment
# python3 --version # check your python version
# sudo apt install python<your_python_version>-venv
# python3 -m venv env
# . env/bin/activate
 
# Install
pip install . 

# To install the dev version:
# pip install .[dev] 
```

### Building and running the tests

For building and running the tests, you will need the following software: pytest, a C++ compiler, and CMake   version 3.14 or higher.

```bash
# Run the Python tests
pytest

# Run the C++ tests
cd tests/cpptests
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
ctest
```

## Usage

The full [API specification](https://murtree.github.io/pymurtree/api_reference.html) is available in the repo's documentation. 

### Example

After installing pymurtree you can use it in your Python code by importing the package. Here's an example of how to build a decision tree classifier from a training dataset, make predictions and export the tree for visualization with [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/):

```python
import pymurtree
import numpy

# Create training data
x = numpy.array([[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0]]) # features
y = numpy.array([5, 5, 4]) # labels

# Build tree classifier
model = pymurtree.OptimalDecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(x, y, max_depth=4, max_num_nodes=5, time=400)

# Predict labels for a new set of features
ft = numpy.array([[1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0]])
labels = model.predict(ft)

# Visualize tree
model.export_text()

# Export tree in DOT format for visualization with graphviz
model.export_dot()
```

### Datasets

A collection of datsets compatible with pymurtree is available in [https://github.com/MurTree/murtree-data](https://github.com/MurTree/murtree-data)
